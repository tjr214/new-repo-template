# Step 2: Extract Data & Analyze Codebase

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

- 📊 **COMPREHENSIVE EXTRACTION**: Pull ALL relevant data from selected epic and story artifacts
- 🔍 **USE EXPLORE SUB-AGENT**: Leverage Task tool with explore sub-agent for codebase analysis
- 🏗️ **INTELLIGENT STRUCTURING**: Map extracted data to phases/steps/instructions
- ✅ **TDD ENRICHMENT**: Add YELLOW-RED-GREEN-BLUE phases to all instructions
- 🚫 **NO GAPS**: Every instruction must be complete and actionable
- 🎯 **SPECIFIC YELLOW PHASES**: Use explore findings to create precise context-gathering instructions
- 📌 **EPIC/STORY SOURCE OF TRUTH**: Build the YAML from epic and story artifacts only
- 🔗 **EXTERNAL DOCS BY REFERENCE**: If PRD/architecture are needed, include file path references only (do not embed their full content)

---

## CONTEXT FROM STEP 1:

You have loaded artifacts from Step 1:

```yaml
loaded_artifacts:
  - name: "..."
    path: "..."
    type: "epic|story|sprint-status"
```

---

## YOUR TASK:

Extract all relevant implementation data from the selected epic and its related stories, then use the explore sub-agent to analyze the codebase and generate comprehensive, specific task instructions with detailed YELLOW phases.

---

## EXECUTION SEQUENCE:

### 1. Read All Selected Artifacts

For each artifact from Step 1, read the complete file:

```bash
# Example for each artifact
cat {artifact_path}
```

Store full content in memory for extraction.

---

### 2. Extract ALL Relevant Data

**From the selected epic and related stories, extract EVERYTHING relevant:**

#### **Task-Level Information:**

- ✅ Epic name and number
- ✅ Epic objective and business outcome
- ✅ Story inventory for the epic
- ✅ Story execution order and dependencies
- ✅ Epic-level success criteria

#### **Requirements & Acceptance Criteria:**

- ✅ Story requirements and acceptance criteria
- ✅ Functional requirements derived from stories
- ✅ Non-functional requirements stated in stories
- ✅ Edge cases and constraints called out by stories

#### **Architecture & Technical Decisions:**

- ✅ Technical decisions explicitly documented in epic/story content
- ✅ Integration points called out in stories
- ✅ Data/API expectations present in story acceptance criteria

#### **Implementation Details:**

- ✅ File paths mentioned
- ✅ Code snippets or examples
- ✅ Dependencies to install
- ✅ Configuration required
- ✅ Environment setup

#### **Testing & Validation:**

- ✅ Test specifications
- ✅ Test scenarios
- ✅ Performance targets (latency, throughput, etc.)
- ✅ Coverage requirements
- ✅ Validation criteria

#### **Context & References:**

- ✅ Existing files to reference
- ✅ Patterns used elsewhere in codebase
- ✅ Similar implementations
- ✅ Documentation references by path only (e.g., PRD/architecture files read during YELLOW)

---

### 3. Analyze Codebase for YELLOW Phase Instructions

**Use the explore sub-agent to discover codebase context:**

Launch the explore sub-agent with "very thorough" mode to analyze the codebase and identify patterns, files, and implementations relevant to the task.

**For each key component mentioned in artifacts, use the Task tool with explore sub-agent:**

#### **A. Identify Existing Patterns:**

```
Launch explore sub-agent for: "Find files and patterns related to {component_type} in the codebase. Search for similar implementations, existing patterns, and conventions. Be very thorough."

Example queries:
- "Find middleware patterns and implementations in this codebase"
- "Locate test conventions and existing test files"
- "Discover authentication/authorization patterns"
- "Find existing API route definitions and patterns"
```

#### **B. Identify Dependencies and Package Usage:**

```
Launch explore sub-agent for: "Search for usage of {package_name} in the codebase. Find import patterns, configuration files, and existing integrations. Be very thorough."

Example queries:
- "Find all Redis usage and configuration patterns"
- "Locate FastAPI usage and route definitions"
- "Discover database connection and ORM patterns"
- "Find existing dependency injection patterns"
```

#### **C. Identify Integration Points:**

```
Launch explore sub-agent for: "Identify integration points for {feature_type}. Find related files, connection patterns, and existing implementations. Be very thorough."

Example queries:
- "Find database connection patterns and configuration"
- "Locate API integration points and existing endpoints"
- "Discover service layer patterns and implementations"
- "Find error handling and logging patterns"
```

#### **D. Consolidate Explore Results:**

After explore sub-agent completes, consolidate findings:

- File paths discovered
- Purpose (what pattern/implementation it demonstrates)
- Relevance (why RALPH should read it during YELLOW phase)
- Code snippets or examples found
- Pattern observations

---

### 4. Structure Into Phases

**Infer logical implementation phases from the extracted data:**

**Common phase patterns:**

**For new features:**

1. Design & Data Modeling
2. Core Implementation
3. Testing & Validation
4. Documentation

**For refactoring:**

1. Analysis & Planning
2. Incremental Refactoring
3. Validation & Regression Testing
4. Cleanup & Documentation

**For integrations:**

1. Setup & Configuration
2. Integration Layer
3. Error Handling & Resilience
4. Testing & Monitoring

**Create phases based on artifact content, not templates!**

---

### 5. Break Down Into Steps

**For each phase, identify discrete implementation steps:**

**Example extraction logic:**

If artifact mentions "Create Redis-backed rate limiter":

- Step 1: Define configuration models
- Step 2: Implement rate limit strategy
- Step 3: Create middleware/dependency
- Step 4: Add performance tests

**Extract from requirements, not guess!**

---

### 6. Generate Comprehensive Instructions with Specific YELLOW

**For each step, create 1-5 detailed instructions:**

#### **Instruction Template:**

````yaml
- id: "instr-{N}.{M}.{P}"
  content: |
    **File:** {explicit_file_path}

    **YELLOW Phase (Gather Context):**
    {SPECIFIC codebase reading instructions generated from analysis}

    - Read `{specific_file_1}` to understand {specific_pattern}
    - Read `{specific_file_2}` for {test_conventions}
    - Search for {specific_usage}: `rg "{search_pattern}" src/`
    - Review `{config_file}` for {configuration_pattern}

    **RED Phase (Write Tests First):**
    {Test specifications extracted from artifact}

    Create `{test_file_path}`:

    ```python
    {complete_test_code_from_artifact_or_inferred}
    ```

    Run: `pytest {test_file_path} -v`
    Expected: FAIL (code doesn't exist yet)

    **GREEN Phase (Implement to Pass Tests):**
    {Implementation guidance from artifact}

    Create `{implementation_file_path}`:

    ```python
    {implementation_code_from_artifact_or_skeleton}
    ```

    Install dependencies: `uv add {package}>=X.Y.Z`

    Run: `pytest {test_file_path} -v`
    Expected: PASS

    **BLUE Phase (Refactor and Clean Up):**
    - Verify LSP shows no type errors
    - Run linter: `ruff check {file_path}`
    - Check coverage: `pytest --cov={module} {test_file_path}`
    - Ensure docstrings follow project style

    **Context References:**
    {From artifact and codebase analysis}
    - Follow pattern from `{existing_file}`
    - Align with {architectural_decision}
    - Use error handling from `{error_handler_file}`

    **Completion Criteria:**
    {From artifact}
    - All tests pass
    - Code coverage >{percentage}%
    - No LSP/linting errors
    - Performance target: <{latency}ms
  status: "pending"
````

### 7. Example: Generating Specific YELLOW Instructions Using Explore Results

**Given artifact content:**

> "Implement rate limiting middleware using Redis, following the existing middleware pattern"

**Use explore sub-agent:**

```
Task: "Find middleware patterns, Redis usage, and test conventions in the codebase. Be very thorough."
```

**Explore sub-agent discovers:**

```
- src/middleware/base_middleware.py (middleware pattern)
- tests/test_auth_middleware.py (test conventions)
- config/redis_config.py (Redis connection pattern)
- src/utils/decorators.py (decorator patterns)
```

**Generated YELLOW phase:**

```yaml
**YELLOW Phase (Gather Context):**
- Read `src/middleware/base_middleware.py` to understand the BaseMiddleware class pattern
- Read `tests/test_auth_middleware.py` to see how middleware tests are structured
- Review `config/redis_config.py` for Redis connection and configuration patterns
- Check `src/utils/decorators.py` for decorator usage patterns in this project
- Review explore findings for any additional Redis usage patterns
- Note any integration patterns discovered by explore sub-agent
```

**This is SPECIFIC, not generic!**
